Sequential Method
=================

The sequential method is characterized by a first strong hypothesis which
supposes that the k states of the signal will follow one after the other
without ever reappearing, even if each ones of them can have a different duration.
For example, we could have a signal where the states follow each other in this way
1-2-3-4-... but not such as 1-2-1-3-4-2-3-...
