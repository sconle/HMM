Welcome to neuroHMM's documentation!
====================================

NeuroHMM is a package for neuroscience data using Hidden Markov Model (HMM).
It is a Python library that provides various tools to analyse, process and display
the data. The project is made by 5 students from the Engineering School of Centrale
Marseille and in partnership with The Timone Neuroscience Institute.

Here you will find easy to use methods to decode a signal from an electroencephalogram
thanks to HMM.

In the section "Theory", we explained everything you need to understand how the
model works such as mathematics underneath. The "User guide" will help you to
have a proper installation of the library. The methods are described in the "API".
Eventually at the end, you will find some examples.
